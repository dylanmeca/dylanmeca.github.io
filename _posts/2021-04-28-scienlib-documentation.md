Scienlib is a scientific Python library that adds mathematical functions and adds other functions like physics, but also has cybersecurity and other functions.

## How to use the library

To use the library you must write the following code:

```python

import scienlib

```

## Basic math

Within the library we have basic mathematical functions.

#### speed calculation

The first basic mathematics is speed, in real life the formula of the speed is ``` v = d ÷ t ```, to use this mathematical formula you have to write the following code:

```python

scienlib.velocity (d,t)

```

where it says ``` d ``` replace it with the distance and where it says ``` t ``` replace it with the time for example:

```python

r = scienlib.velocity (20,8)
print (r)

```

and the result would be: ``` 2.5 ```

What happened here is that the distance was divided by time, what I would be doing is recreating the formula of speed equals distance over time.

#### Get the divider of a number

There is a mathematical function inside the library that helps you to obtain the devider of a number.

to use this mathematical function you must put the following code:

```python

scienlib.divider (n,c)

```

where it says ``` n ``` must be replaced by the number that we will use to determine what number will be the devider at that time, where ``` c ``` is the candidate that we will use to know the devider of the number, example:

```python

r = scienlib.divider (14,7)
print (r)

```

What happened here is that the result was obtained if 14 is a devider of 7 and the result is ``` True ```, by default in the code it will be ``` True ``` if it is true and ``` False ``` if it is false.

#### How to find the average

To find the average you must put the following code:

```python

list = [17,15,14,10]
r = scienlib.average (list)
print (r)

```

what this does is find the average of the numbers in a list the operation it does is add everything and divide it by the amount of data there is.

the result of this example is 14.0 and what the code did was add everything and divide it by the amount of data.

## cybersecurity

the bookstore also have cybersecurity functions.

#### Scan ports

To scan the ports you have to put the following code.

```python

r = scienlib.scanports ("192.168.1.1")
print (r)

```

what this does is scan all the ports of an ip where it says ``` 192.168.1.1 ``` you can replace it with the ip you want to scan.

#### Scan port

To scan a port you must put this code:

```python

scienlib.scanport ("192.168.1.1", "80")

```

what this does is scan the port of an ip in that example we observe that the port is 80 and the ip 192.168.1.1 but we can change that to scan the port we want.

#### Scan ip

to scan an ip we have to put these codes:

```python

scienlib.scanip (ip)

```

where ip we have to replace it with a public ip that we want to scan this scanner can be used in case you locate the ip of a person who hacked your wifi that way you could know if that hacker is from your city or from another since that gives security details.

But you could also use it to know if the IP of your connection to a VPN is correct.

#### Scan web

to scan your website for vulnerabilities you must put this code:

```python

scienlib.scanweb ("http://192.168.1.1")

```

What this does is scan the website and look for its vulnerabilities, as the creator of the website you can try to improve the site so that there are no vulnerabilities.

the ip you are scanning in the example you can replace it with the ip you want to scan but that ip has to have the format of the site which is ``` http ``` or ``` https ``` but if the site has DNS you just have to put ``` https://example.com ``` to be scan the website.
